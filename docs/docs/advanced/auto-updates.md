# Auto-Updates

MailCade updates itself automatically. No manual downloads needed.

## How it works

The app checks for updates when it launches and once a day after that. When there's a new version:

- You get a notification
- It downloads in the background
- You decide when to install

Your settings and emails are preserved.

## Checking for updates

By default, auto-update is on (Settings → General → Auto-update). MailCade checks for new versions automatically.

Want to check right now? Go to Settings → Updates → Check for Updates. You'll see your current version, the latest version, and release notes.

## Installing updates

When an update is ready, you'll see a notification. Click "Install Update" and MailCade restarts with the new version.

If you're in the middle of something, just ignore it. The update waits for you - install it whenever you're ready.

All your settings and current emails stick around. Nothing gets lost.

## Skipping updates

Not ready for an update? Click "Skip This Version" and you won't be bothered about it again. You'll still get notified about future versions.

## Manual updates

If auto-update is off or something goes wrong, you can always download the latest version from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/olakunlevpn/MailCade/releases) and install it manually.

## Troubleshooting

**Update check fails?** Check your internet connection and try again in a few minutes.

**Download fails?** Make sure you have enough disk space. Try again or download manually.

**Install fails?** Quit MailCade completely, download the new version manually, and install it over the old one.

## Turning it off

You can turn off auto-update in Settings → General → Auto-update, but we don't recommend it. You'll miss out on fixes and new features.
